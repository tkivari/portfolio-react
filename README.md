## Hi! Thanks for stopping by!

This repository holds the code to my [online CV](https://tyler.digital)

This project was created with ReactJS, Redux, and Stylus, and is dockerized for easy deployment.  You can deploy the app with the following commands:

```
  docker-compose up -d
```

This will automatically build a production version of the JavaScript and start an nginx container to host the site on port 80.
